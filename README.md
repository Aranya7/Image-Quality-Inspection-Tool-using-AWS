# Image-Quality-Inspection-Tool-using-AWS
The project acts as a quality inspection tool for machines that automates the process of error 
detection using Machine Learning and in turn simplifies the error detection mechanism in machines 
and circuits. 

This ML and cloud-based project can also help a user detect errors with high accuracy 
and could reduce a lot of manual labour and expense. 

Using AWS Cloud services, we will build an 
automated image quality inspection tool using Amazon Lookout for vision. The project addresses 
interesting use cases such as drone detection, defect detection, object detection, smile detection, 
fall detection.
